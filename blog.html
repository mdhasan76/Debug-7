            <h1>1. Difference Between Global scope and Block Scope.</h1>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                    <strong>Global scope:</strong> When we decleare a variable outside of {} & function . we can access
                    those variable from anyhere on this file. Even in scope ,function & {}.Global scope is controled by
                    Window object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Block Scope:</strong> We describe Block that A block is a peace of code inside {} brackets
                    and a
                    function
                    scope or groups code statment togather. wright a variable using let and const inside if , else, for

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <article>
            <h1>2. Difference between Local storage and Session storage.</h1>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                    Session storage is similar to local storage. The diffence is while user/client leave the borwser.
                    local storage data doesn't expire. it saves this data on this praticular browser. But the session
                    storage doesnt it. When user/client leave or relode this tab\page the session storage data is
                    cleared .

        <!-- question 3 -->
        <article>
            <h1>3. How does work Javascript Event loop?</h1>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                    The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
